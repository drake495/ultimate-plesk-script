The ultimate Plesk script:

This script can be use to troubleshoot and do common tasks on plesk servers.

Read the changelog in the comments of the script to see full functionality. 


OS support: Centos, Ubuntu, Fedora

Has been tested on Plesk versions 8.6 - 10.2

I will continue to update it as I get better at bash scripting and 
the more I troubleshoot plesk at my job as a server technician. 

Let me know if you find any bugs. I'm sure there are some. 


Thanks,
Derek
